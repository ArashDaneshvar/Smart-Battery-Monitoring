# Listen to the collected recording (with audio-preview) and check the audio quality in the different cases. 
# Also, fill the table below and comment the results. 
# Finally, define an equation that computes the wave file size as a function of resolution, sampling rate, #channels, and recording duration. 
# Double-check the equation with the collected statistics.
