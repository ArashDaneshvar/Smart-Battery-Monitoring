What we did in this project    
Develop ML pipelines for IoT applications  
• Collect data with sensors  
• Store & process data  
• Train & optimize ML models for IoT data  
• Deploy ML models at the IoT edge  
• Implement edge-to-cloud/cloud-to-edge communication  
Programming language:  
• Python  
Tools/IDEs:  
• Visual Studio Code (local development)  
• Deepnote (cloud development)  
• Redis (cloud storage)  

______
**Use Case: Smart Battery Monitoring**    
• Remote monitoring of the Battery status of a connected Device
